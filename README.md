## Basic.cpp
The `Basic.cpp` file is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic input and output operations. It includes the iostream library for handling input and output and uses the standard namespace. The program prints "Hello World!" to the console and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

### Code Explanation
```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include the iostream library for input and output

using namespace std; // Use the standard namespace

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl; // Print "Hello World!" to the console
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

- `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations in C++.
- `using namespace std;`: This line allows the program to use the standard namespace, so you don't have to prefix standard library names with `std::`.
- `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
- `cout << "Hello World!" << endl;`: This line prints "Hello World!" to the console.
- `return 0;`: This line returns 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully.
